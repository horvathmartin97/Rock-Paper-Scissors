Number Guessing Game
🕹️ Overview
A fun and simple Number Guessing Game written in pure JavaScript.
Try to guess the computer’s secret number between 1 and 100 — but be careful, you only have 10 attempts!

This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as:

Random number generation

Conditional logic

Input validation

User interaction via alert, prompt, and confirm

🧠 How It Works
The player is greeted and asked if they want to play.

After entering a name, the game picks a random number between 1–100.

The player guesses numbers, and the game gives feedback:

🟢 “Correct!” – You win!

🔺 “Too high!” – Try a smaller number.

🔻 “Too low!” – Go higher next time.

You have 10 guesses total. If you run out, the correct number is revealed.

🧩 Features
✅ Input validation for numbers between 1–100

✅ Tracks and displays remaining attempts

✅ Fun, lightweight, and browser-ready

✅ Uses recursive validation and clean function structure
